## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 Minutes)

1. **Start Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Backend (from backend/ directory)
   npm run dev

   # Frontend (from frontend/ directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Builder**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/yavi-studio/builder-v3
   ```

3. **Generate Application**:
   - Select Industry: **Legal**
   - Prompt: `Create a contract analyzer dashboard`
   - Click: **Generate Application**
   - Wait: 15-20 seconds (slightly longer due to more complex generation)

4. **Review Generated Files**:
   - Check middle panel (File Tree)
   - Expected: 8-12 files (not 2-3)
   - Should see: components/, utils/, multiple .tsx files

5. **Check Approval Modal**:
   - Review file list
   - Look for: MetricCard.tsx, Chart.tsx, mockData.ts, animations.ts
   - File contents should be longer (100+ lines vs 30)

6. **Approve and View Preview**:
   - Click **Approve**
   - Wait for preview to load
   - Expected to see:
     - ✅ Gradient backgrounds
     - ✅ Animated metric cards
     - ✅ Data visualizations (charts)
     - ✅ Professional styling (blues, purples, gold)
     - ✅ Multiple components (not just text)

## Success Criteria

### Before vs After Comparison

| Metric | Before | After (Expected) |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Files Generated | 2-3 | 8-12 |
| Total Lines of Code | 50-100 | 800-1000+ |
| Components | 1-2 basic | 5+ polished |
| Styling | None/minimal | Tailwind + gradients |
| Animations | None | Framer Motion throughout |
| Visualizations | None | Recharts charts |
| Mock Data | None/minimal | 20-50 realistic items |
| Preview Quality | Basic text | Portfolio-worthy |

### Visual Indicators of Success

**You'll know it worked if you see:**

1. **File Tree** (Middle Panel):
   ```
   src/
     App.tsx
     components/
       Dashboard.tsx
       Navigation.tsx
       Sidebar.tsx
       MetricCard.tsx
       DataTable.tsx
       Chart.tsx
       Card.tsx
     utils/
       mockData.ts
       animations.ts
   package.json
   README.md
   ```

2. **Preview** (Right Panel):
   - Gradient header (blue to purple)
   - Animated navbar with glassmorphism
   - 4 metric cards with icons
   - Data table with contracts
   - Bar/line charts showing data
   - Professional color scheme
   - Smooth hover effects

3. **Code Quality**:
   - TypeScript types throughout
   - Framer Motion imports
   - Recharts imports
   - Lucide icon imports
   - Tailwind classes with gradients
   - Mock data arrays with 20+ items

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting 2-3 Files

**Possible Cause**: AI model ignoring detailed instructions (rare but possible)

**Solution**: Use more explicit prompt:
```
Create a comprehensive legal contract analyzer dashboard with:
- Animated navigation bar with glassmorphism
- 4 animated metric cards showing contract statistics
- Sortable data table of contracts
- Bar chart showing contract types by month
- Line chart showing contract value trends
- Search and filter functionality
- Modern design with gradients, shadows, and smooth animations
Use Framer Motion, Recharts, Lucide icons, and Tailwind CSS.
Generate multiple component files with production-ready code.
```

### If Preview Still Basic

**Possible Cause**: Libraries not loading properly

**Check**:
1. Open preview in new tab
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for errors loading framer-motion or recharts
4. Verify generated code includes proper imports

### If Database Errors Appear

**Note**: Prisma connection errors are expected and don't affect functionality.

These are safe to ignore:
```
PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database server
```

Generation and preview work independently of database.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Start backend server
2. ✅ Start frontend server
3. ✅ Test generation with Legal industry
4. ✅ Compare results with previous basic generation
5. ✅ Verify 8+ files with rich content

### After Testing
- If successful: Document results, share with stakeholders
- If improvements needed: Fine-tune prompts based on output
- Consider: Adding more industry-specific templates
- Consider: Creating reusable component library
