## üîç Testing Checklist

Test the enhancement by checking these items:

### Generation Phase
- [ ] Navigate to Builder v3
- [ ] Select "Legal" industry
- [ ] Enter prompt: "Create a contract analyzer dashboard"
- [ ] Click "Generate Application"
- [ ] Wait 15-20 seconds

### File Review Phase
- [ ] Check file count: Should see 8-12 files
- [ ] Verify files include:
  - [ ] App.tsx
  - [ ] Dashboard.tsx
  - [ ] Navigation.tsx
  - [ ] MetricCard.tsx
  - [ ] Chart.tsx
  - [ ] mockData.ts
  - [ ] animations.ts
- [ ] Check file contents: Should see 100+ lines in main components
- [ ] Verify imports:
  - [ ] `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`
  - [ ] `import { BarChart, LineChart } from 'recharts'`
  - [ ] `import { icons } from 'lucide-react'`

### Preview Phase

## üí° If Results Are Still Basic

If you still see only 2-3 files with minimal content, try these solutions:

### Solution 1: More Detailed Prompt
Instead of:
```
Create a contract analyzer
```

Try:
```
Create a comprehensive legal contract analyzer dashboard with:
- Animated navigation bar with glassmorphism effect
- 4 animated metric cards showing contract statistics (total, active, billable hours, satisfaction)
- Sortable data table of contracts with status badges and risk indicators
- Bar chart showing contract types distribution
- Line chart showing contract value trends over time
- Search functionality with icon
- Filter dropdowns
- Modern design with blue-purple gradients, shadows, and smooth animations
Use Framer Motion for animations, Recharts for charts, Lucide icons for UI, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Generate multiple component files with production-ready, beautiful code.
```

### Solution 2: Check AI Model Response
The AI models (GPT-4/Claude) can occasionally ignore instructions if:
- The user prompt is too vague
- The AI interprets the request as wanting simplicity
- Token limits cause truncation

**Check**: Open browser console and look for AI generation logs

### Solution 3: Verify Backend is Using Enhanced Prompts
```bash
cd backend/src/services
grep "world-class software architect" ai.ts
```

Should return the enhanced prompt text. If not, the file may not have saved correctly.

## üé® Test Different Industries

Try generating apps in different industries to see variety:

### Legal (Blues & Gold)
```
Create a contract analyzer dashboard
```

### Construction (Orange & Steel Gray)
```
Create a project management dashboard
```

### Healthcare (Medical Blue & Green)
```
Create a patient management dashboard
```

### Financial (Green & Navy)
```
Create a financial analytics dashboard
```

Each should use industry-specific colors, icons, and terminology.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Preview Still Blank
**Solution**: This was fixed in previous session. If it happens:
1. Open preview in new tab
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `/api/preview/generate` endpoint is working

### Issue: Servers Not Running
**Check**:
```bash
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
lsof -i :5001  # Backend
```

**Restart**:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Issue: Database Connection Errors
These are expected and safe to ignore:
```
PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database server
```

Generation and preview work independently of database.
