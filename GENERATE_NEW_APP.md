# üéØ Generate a NEW Application to See Enhanced Results

## Important: You're Viewing an Old Preview

The preview you're seeing is from a **previous generation** (before the enhanced prompts were implemented). That's why it still shows the basic legal Dashboard with minimal content.

The enhanced prompts **ARE** active in the backend - you just need to generate a fresh application!

---

## Step-by-Step: Generate New App with Enhanced Prompts

### Step 1: Go to Builder v3
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/yavi-studio/builder-v3
```

### Step 2: Clear Any Previous Generation
- If you see files in the middle panel from previous generation, click the "Clear" or "New Project" button (if available)
- Or just start a fresh generation - it will replace the old one

### Step 3: Select Industry
Click **"Legal"** in the left sidebar

### Step 4: Enter Detailed Prompt
In the text area, enter:
```
Create a comprehensive contract analyzer dashboard with animated metric cards, sortable data tables, and beautiful charts showing contract analytics
```

**Why a detailed prompt?** The AI responds better to specific requests, even though our enhanced system prompt now requests production-quality code automatically.

### Step 5: Click "Generate Application"
- Click the big **"Generate Application"** button
- Wait 15-20 seconds (it may take longer than before because it's generating more files and complex code)

### Step 6: Watch the File Generation
In the middle panel, you should start seeing files appear:
- ‚úÖ App.tsx
- ‚úÖ Dashboard.tsx
- ‚úÖ Navigation.tsx
- ‚úÖ MetricCard.tsx
- ‚úÖ DataTable.tsx
- ‚úÖ Chart.tsx
- ‚úÖ mockData.ts
- ‚úÖ animations.ts
- ‚úÖ package.json
- ‚úÖ README.md

**If you only see 2-3 files**, the AI may have ignored the enhanced prompt (rare but possible).

### Step 7: Review File Contents
Click on **Dashboard.tsx** in the file tree

**Expected to see**:
```typescript
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { BarChart, LineChart } from 'recharts';
import { icons } from 'lucide-react';
// ... 150+ lines of code
```

**If you see just 30 lines with basic text**, the enhancement didn't work.

### Step 8: Approve the Generation
Click **"Approve"** button in the modal

### Step 9: Check Preview
Wait for preview to load

**Expected to see**:
- ‚úÖ Gradient backgrounds (blue to purple)
- ‚úÖ Animated metric cards with icons
- ‚úÖ Charts/visualizations
- ‚úÖ Professional styling
- ‚úÖ Multiple components

**If you see basic text**, the generation was minimal again.

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old Generation (What You're Seeing Now)
```
Files: 2 (page.tsx, Dashboard.tsx)
Preview: "legal Dashboard" + basic text
Code: ~50 lines total
```

### New Generation (What You Should See)
```
Files: 8-12 (App, Dashboard, Navigation, MetricCard, Chart, etc.)
Preview: Beautiful dashboard with gradients, animations, charts
Code: 800+ lines total
```

---

## If New Generation is Still Basic

### Possible Causes:

1. **Backend not restarted** after ai.ts changes
   - Solution: Restart backend server in Cursor terminal

2. **AI model ignoring prompts** (rare)
   - Solution: Use a more detailed prompt (see below)

3. **Frontend cache** showing old preview
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) or clear browser cache

### More Detailed Prompt to Force Enhancement

If the simple prompt doesn't work, try this:

```
Create a comprehensive legal contract analyzer dashboard with the following features:

1. Animated navigation bar with glassmorphism effect and logo
2. Four metric cards showing:
   - Total Contracts (with trend indicator)
   - Active Cases (with percentage change)
   - Billable Hours (with comparison)
   - Client Satisfaction Score (with rating)
3. Sortable data table of contracts with:
   - Contract name, date, parties involved
   - Status badges (Active, Expired, Pending)
   - Risk level indicators (Low, Medium, High)
   - Action buttons on hover
4. Bar chart showing contract types distribution
5. Line chart showing contract value over time
6. Search bar with icon
7. Filter dropdowns for status and risk level

Design requirements:
- Use deep blue (#1E40AF) and gold (#F59E0B) color scheme for legal industry
- Add smooth animations with Framer Motion (fade in, slide up, hover effects)
- Include data visualizations with Recharts
- Use Lucide icons for all UI elements
- Apply Tailwind CSS with gradients, shadows, and glassmorphism
- Generate mock data with 30-50 realistic contracts
- Create separate component files for reusability
- Make it production-ready and portfolio-worthy

Generate multiple files: App.tsx, Dashboard.tsx, Navigation.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, MetricCard.tsx, DataTable.tsx, Chart.tsx, Card.tsx, mockData.ts, animations.ts, package.json, and README.md
```

This **extremely detailed prompt** should force the AI to generate the complete application.

## Backend Server Status Check

Before generating, verify backend is running with enhanced prompts:

### Check Backend Terminal
Should show:
```
üöÄ Backend server running on port 5001
```

### Test Backend Health
Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:5001/health
```

Should return JSON with status.

### Check AI Service Loaded
In backend terminal, you should see no errors about ai.ts loading.

If backend shows errors or isn't running, restart it:
```bash
cd /Users/rahuldeshmukh/Downloads/Nimbusnext-Yavi-2026/dyad-web-platform/backend
npm run dev
```

## Debug: Check What Backend is Generating

If you want to see what the backend is actually sending to the AI:

1. **Add console log** to backend (temporarily)
2. **Generate** an app in Builder v3
3. **Check backend terminal** for the system prompt being used
4. **Verify** it includes the enhanced prompt text

Alternatively, check the network tab in browser DevTools:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Generate app
4. Find the `/api/generation/start` request
5. Check the request payload
