# ✅ Server Startup Issue Fixed

## Problem Identified
The `tsx watch` command was creating conflicts with multiple instances trying to watch the same file, causing:
```
[tsx] Previous process hasn't exited yet. Force killing...
[tsx] Process didn't exit in 5s. Force killing...
```

## Solution Applied

Changed `backend/package.json` to use **tsx without watch mode** by default:

### Before:
```json
"dev": "tsx watch src/simple-server.ts"
```

### After:
```json
"dev": "tsx src/simple-server.ts"
```

Now `npm run dev` runs tsx directly (no watch mode conflicts).
If you need watch mode, use `npm run dev:watch`.

## How to Start Servers Now (Clean)

### Step 1: Close All Terminals in Cursor
- Stop any running backend/frontend processes (Ctrl+C)
- Close the terminal tabs to clear the stuck processes

### Step 2: Open Fresh Terminals

**Terminal 1 - Backend**:
```bash
cd /Users/rahuldeshmukh/Downloads/Nimbusnext-Yavi-2026/dyad-web-platform/backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
```bash
cd /Users/rahuldeshmukh/Downloads/Nimbusnext-Yavi-2026/dyad-web-platform/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Expected Output

**Backend (Terminal 1)**:
```
🚀 Backend server running on port 5001
📱 Health check: http://localhost:5001/health
🔗 API endpoint: http://localhost:5001/api
🌐 Frontend: http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend (Terminal 2)**:
```
▲ Next.js 14.2.32
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env.local

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 1234ms
```

## Advantages of This Fix

### Without Watch Mode (npm run dev):
- ✅ No process conflicts
- ✅ Clean startup/shutdown
- ✅ Faster initial start
- ✅ More stable for production testing
- ⚠️ Need to restart manually after code changes

### With Watch Mode (npm run dev:watch):
- ✅ Auto-reloads on code changes
- ⚠️ Can cause tsx conflicts if multiple instances run
- ⚠️ Slower shutdown (5s timeout)

**Recommendation**: Use `npm run dev` (no watch) for testing the enhanced prompts.

## If You Still See Issues

### Issue 1: Port Already in Use
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001
```

**Fix**:
```bash
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9
```

### Issue 2: Frontend Won't Start
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

**Fix**:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Issue 3: tsx Still Showing Force Kill Messages

**Fix**: Close ALL terminal tabs in Cursor, then open fresh ones. The issue is usually stuck background processes in the terminal session.

---

## Alternative: Use Node Directly (No tsx)

If you still have issues with tsx, you can run the server directly:

```bash
cd backend
node --loader tsx src/simple-server.ts
```

Or compile first:
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
node dist/simple-server.js
```

---

## Now Test the Enhanced Prompts! 🚀

Once both servers are running cleanly:

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/yavi-studio/builder-v3
2. Select: "Legal" industry
3. Prompt: "Create a contract analyzer dashboard"
4. Generate and see 8-12 beautiful files!

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Changed `npm run dev` to not use watch mode
✅ **Alternative**: Added `npm run dev:watch` for watch mode if needed
✅ **Stable**: No more tsx process conflicts
✅ **Ready**: Start fresh terminals and run `npm run dev` in each

**Next**: Close your Cursor terminals, open fresh ones, and start the servers!
